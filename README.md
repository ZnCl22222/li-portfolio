# About me
Hi, everyone! My name is Li Huixuan, or you can call me Connie. I am a first-year student in the MSPPM-DA program at Heinz College. I am passionate about data science, and I enjoy the process of identifying valid information within cluttered data and producing concise, beautiful visualizations.

# What I hope to learn
Being a non-designer, my previous data visualization process has always been based on my own aesthetic. Such visualizations, however, may not be able to communicate clearly to the audience, so I want to learn more systematically how to tell stories with data and convey information in an attractive and complete way. I would like to pursue a career in data science after graduation. Although I have been exploring specific industries, I am interested in trying consulting or other new industries that I have not been exposed to previously in my internship next summer.
