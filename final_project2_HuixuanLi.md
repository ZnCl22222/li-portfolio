## User research and interviews
### Target audience 
General public. The primary goal is to bring the issue to the attention of women who are able to empathize with menstrual shame, but who are less aware of menstrual poverty, as well as men who have heard about or are unaware of menstrual shame and poverty. Other women who are experiencing menstrual poverty and men who are aware of and concerned about related topics may also learn something new from the project. It is most helpful to improve menstrual shame and poverty if general public are aware of and concerned about it.

### Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview
According to the target audience, I primarily interviewed women who were concerned about or experienced menstrual shame, as well as men who were completely unaware of menstruation and men who heard about the topic. The main interviewers were classmates and friends, etc.

| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1. What story do you think this site is telling？ | It explains Period Shaming and Period Poverty and how serious they are. And it reminds people to be concerned about these problems. | It talks about period shaming and obstacles of access to menstrual products. | About the period shame& poverty. | Period shame and Period poverty. |
| 2. Which part of it impressed you the most? | Pictures showing temporary or unsanitary measures & High tampon taxes in European | In the map, when I saw the sheds women are forced to live in during menstruation. Also the substitutes to menstrual products. | The first page that show Menstrual cup. Menstrual cups are inexpensive but would be considered shameful in some areas. Put together with the theme, it immediately triggers an association. | Women spend one in eight of their lives experiencing menstruation, as well as the three in five women who still feel shame about it. Use plastic bags as an alternative to sanitary napkins. |
| 3. Have you learned something from the website? | Yes, I get to know how some women are suffering from periods besides physical. And I realized men and women should work together to dismiss Period Shaming and Period Poverty.  |  73% of women hide their menstrual products on their way to the bathroom. It resonates with me the most because I still do this. It is kind of surprising (or might be not)  to see how many other women do the same. | Before that, I didn't know that menstrual products were lacking in some areas. And that there was such a large population lacking them. | There are so many people who can't afford to use tampons and sanitary napkins! |
| 4. What is your previous attitude towards period shaming and poverty before viewing the website? And what is the current attitude? Any differences? | I didn't know period shaming was that serious before reading this website. When I was in middle school, I didn’t feel the pressure that girls may face when they were in their period. But now I think it is a problem to be solved. I feel there are more things to do, like stop others making jokes on period. I have seen some posts saying that some women were using very cheap pads in their period. I felt shocked at that moment. Now I know it is a worldwide issue rather than an individual finance problem. Government should regard it as important as other essential products in poverty alleviation.  |  I guess I am still living through the period of shaming somehow – as I still hide my menstrual products. But I didn’t realize today that women are still forced to live in or banned from certain places. | I did not face with the jokes from others; however, I would hide a pad on my way to the bathroom and avoided mentioning menstruation when men are present. I am thinking about why I feel shame. I will try to not hide it next time. | I realized that women were experiencing menstrual shame and menstrual poverty, but I still didn't know if there was anything I could do about it as I never made those jokes. |
| 5. Tell me something you like/dislike about the color & layout | Using red as the topic color gives a uniform impression. Countries' names are difficult to see in Price for one tampon around the world, because of the red color of the bar chart. Use a darker color. | I really like the color choice of dark red, and it all ties together. | I like the overall crimson theme. The color is similar to the color of menstruation. Also，this color will make people more serious when reading. | Consistent format. Love the part that moves with the map. |
| 6. Are the visualizations clear in what they are showing? Any suggestions on how to make improvements? | Cannot understand the figure with 73% on the pads (No explanation when hover mouse). Some label in bar chart are overlapping, maybe use radius instead of color to present the price. | visualizations are good. I might suggest changing the picture to talk about how Indian women during menstruation are not allowed to enter temples. Or might be to add a caption (is this a mural art related to menstrual shame in India?) | Yes, it is clear. | Some of the visualizations need to be explained more clearly by adding explanations at the subheadings. The information presented in the menstrual supplies price bar chart and bubble charts overlap, so perhaps consider deleting the bar chart. |
| 7. Is the logical structure clear, and are the connecting parts between different sections clear? | It should be Period Shaming and Period Poverty (or I will understand as poverty). Good storyline: from period shame to menstrual products to Period Poverty. There might be one more further explanation that ‘High price and taxes force women to use other cheap substitutes instead of sanitary menstrual products. | It looks good to me. I may want to switch the order of pricing menstrual products with tampon substitutes. It helps to make a point that because the products are expensive, many women have to use horrible substitutes. | Overall very logical, menstrual shame converts to menstrual poverty | I would change the order of the paragraphs describing the graphics and the graphics, which are now presented in a somewhat strange way. |
| 8. Is there enough evidence to support the main point? | The last two charts focused on tampons. What is the situation for other menstrual products?  | It is really impressive. Just being picky about the argument that women worldwide will feel embarrassed to talk about menstruation, I would be curious about the regional distribution. | I think so. | Should elaborate more on tampon tax issue. Why does this happen and is it unreasonable to pay taxes this way? |
| 9. Is there something you want to know but are not covered in the visualization？ | What causes the variety of price of menstrual products widely among countries with similar GDP per capita? Period Shaming? | Maybe if there are any good policies in certain countries that others can follow? | When I read "even in countries where most people consider themselves modern and rational," I had a desire to know about menstrual shame in such a country. In addition, I wanted to know the attitude of international organizations or governments towards menstrual shame and poverty, and what is the behavior, if any, to make improvements for this. | What we as men can do？ |
