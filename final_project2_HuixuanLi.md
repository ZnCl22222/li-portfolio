## User research and interviews
### Target audience 
General public. The primary goal is to bring the issue to the attention of women who are able to empathize with menstrual shame, but who are less aware of menstrual poverty, as well as men who have heard about or are unaware of menstrual shame and poverty. It is most helpful to improve menstrual shame and poverty if general public are aware of and concerned about it.
