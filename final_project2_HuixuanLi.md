## User research and interviews
### Target audience 
General public. The primary goal is to bring the issue to the attention of women who are able to empathize with menstrual shame, but who are less aware of menstrual poverty, as well as men who have heard about or are unaware of menstrual shame and poverty. Other women who are experiencing menstrual poverty and men who are aware of and concerned about related topics may also learn something new from the project. It is most helpful to improve menstrual shame and poverty if general public are aware of and concerned about it.

### Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview
According to the target audience, I interviewed mainly women who are concerned about or have experienced the shame of menstruation and men who do not know about menstruation at all. The main interviewers were classmates and friends, etc.
