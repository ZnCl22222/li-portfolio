# Original Visualization
Gender wage gap for the most common occupations for women in the United States in 2021, by median weekly earnings
https://www.statista.com/statistics/244096/us-gender-wage-gap-for-the-20-most-common-occupations-for-women/

I chose this visualization because I am personally interested in gender issues, especially in quantifiable gender inequality in the context of the labor economy. I am also currently conducting a research project on the reasons for the decline in the labor force of immigrant women before and after the epidemic through IPUMPS census and survey data. I was trying to find a visualization related to gender issues on the statista and came across this title, Gender Wage Gap. However, when I clicked on the visualization I found that it only listed the wage of men and women, with no way to get the information I was looking for such as the occupations with the largest gender differences. I thought there was a lot of room for revision in this visualization, so I chose this one.

# Critique the Data Visualization
From the Stephen Few's methodology, we were able to re-evaluate this visualization in two major aspects and seven minor aspects.
- Informative
  - Usefulness
  - Completeness
  - Perceptibility
  - Truthfulness
  - Intuitiveness
