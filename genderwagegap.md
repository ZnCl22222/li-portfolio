# Original Visualization
Gender wage gap for the most common occupations for women in the United States in 2021, by median weekly earnings
https://www.statista.com/statistics/244096/us-gender-wage-gap-for-the-20-most-common-occupations-for-women/

I chose this visualization because I am personally interested in gender issues, especially in quantifiable gender inequality in the context of the labor economy. 
I was trying to find a visualization related to gender issues on the statista and came across this title, Gender Wage Gap. 
However, when I clicked on the visualization I found that it only listed the wage of men and women, 
with no way to get the information I was looking for such as the occupations with the largest gender differences. 
I thought there was a lot of room for revision in this visualization, so I chose this one.
