# Original Visualization
Gender wage gap for the most common occupations for women in the United States in 2021, by median weekly earnings
https://www.statista.com/statistics/244096/us-gender-wage-gap-for-the-20-most-common-occupations-for-women/

I chose this visualization because I am personally interested in gender issues, especially in quantifiable gender inequality in the context of the labor economy. I am also currently conducting a research project on the reasons for the decline in the labor force of immigrant women before and after the epidemic through IPUMPS census and survey data. I was trying to find a visualization related to gender issues on the statista and came across this title, Gender Wage Gap. However, when I clicked on the visualization I found that it only listed the wage of men and women, with no way to get the information I was looking for such as the occupations with the largest gender differences. I thought there was a lot of room for revision in this visualization, so I chose this one.

# Critique the Data Visualization
From the Stephen Few's methodology, we were able to re-evaluate this visualization in two major aspects and seven minor aspects.
- Informative
  - Usefulness
  - Completeness
  - Perceptibility
  - Truthfulness
  - Intuitiveness
- Emotive
  - Aesthetics
  - Engagement

According to our criticize, the intuitiveness, truthfulness, and completeness of the original visualization are already well done, and we need to improve mainly in other areas:
- Usefulness: In order to increase the usefulness of the data, we decided to get the data on women's income as percentage of men's income from the original data, which can be more intuitive for the audience to recognize the difference between women's and men's income.
- Perceptibility: In order to make it easier for the audience to compare the magnitude of gender differences between occupations, we chose to rank the data in order of the magnitude of gender differences, from largest to smallest.
- Aesthetics: I will use contrasting colors to label males and females, as well as using gray to reflect the difference between male and female wages.
- Engagement: I will display a summary line of text or number somewhere in the visualization to achieve the interaction with the user and enhance the user experience. The user only needs to select a certain occupation to get information about the difference in salary between men and women and the specific salary of that occupation.
