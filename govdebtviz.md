# Government debt visualization

## Government debt bar chart
Use bar chart to show the debt-to-GDP ratio of each country in 2019

## Grid of line charts
Use line graphs to show the change in the debt-to-GDP ratio of each country along time

## Map of government debt
Use the size and color shades of the points in the map to indicate the debt-to-GDP ratio size of the country at a specific point in the timeline (it can be interpreted that larger points indicate a larger debt-to-GDP ratio and darker colors indicate a high risk of an economic slowdown). The reason for using both size and color is to double emphasize the high risk of economic slowdown associated with high debt-to-GDP ratios.

The data we use are from the government debt data in the OECD. It is panel data that records the dept-to-GDP ratio data for each country in each year. The use of a grid line graph allows a clear representation of the change in the ratio along time for each country. However, the fact that we have listed each country separately makes it difficult to compare the ratios for each country over the same period. This is the opposite of the first bar chart visualization, in which we could clearly compare the ratios for each country in a given year, but had no way of knowing the historical trend.

The third visualization combines the advantages of both of above visualizations. The timeline can be paused to see the ratio for each country for a specific year, or played back to focus on the trend for a particular country. Also, because the data is visualized on a map and ratios are represented using color shades and point sizes, audiences can get a more clear picture of how ratios look around the world.
