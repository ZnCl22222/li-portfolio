# Outline
## Summary
In the year 2022, menstrual poverty is still widespread today. This project will focus on two aspects of menstrual poverty: cognitive poverty and economic poverty. Cognitive poverty leads to socio-cultural shame and taboos about menstruation, which perpetuates the invisible environmental pressure on women. Economic poverty, on the other hand, can lead to difficulties in accessing physiological health knowledge and menstrual hygiene products, posing a threat to women's health.

## Project Structure
### Basic Menstruation Info
First I will use a series of visual data on menstruation to construct basic knowledge for those who do not have an understanding of it. For example, I am going to use the following data:
- A woman will have her period more than 450 times in her lifetime
- Women menstruate for about 10 years of their lives
- A woman will consume 11,000 tampons in her lifetime

With the above data, the audience will learn that menstruation is not a taboo and insignificant topic, but an important issue for all women.

### Cognitive Poverty
In this section I will discuss menstrual shame. Even though menstruation is such a normal physiological phenomenon (as described in the previous section), it is still taboo and even a disease in some disadvantaged regions. 
I will begin with case studies from some countries, such as Nepal, where women have to leave their homes during menstruation and go to menstrual huts to spend their periods. In China, women who are menstruating are considered "unclean" and are not allowed to attend funerals.

After that I will show some data from the survey, such as whether you can talk openly about menstruation, the percentage of women who feel shame, the percentage of men who joke about their partner's menstruation, the percentage of women who have hidden tampons, etc. With this data, I expect the audience to realize that menstrual shame is a real thing, and that there are many women who are feeling pressure and even verbal violence because of this female specific biological phenomenon. And it's not just about women, it's about the oppression of women brought on by men and society as a whole.

### Economics Poverty
In this section, I will show how expensive sanitary products are by starting with the current global prices of sanitary products and plotting visualizations such as the ranking of sanitary napkin prices by country and the ratio of sanitary product prices to GDP. Then I will present the reasons for the high price of sanitary napkins, namely the expensive sanitary napkin tax. And plot an overview of sanitary napkin taxes around the world.

After understanding how expensive sanitary napkins are, I will present demographic information such as the number of women suffering from menstrual poverty worldwide, regional distribution, etc. I will also present their current situation, such as the use of products like newspapers and cloths instead of sanitary napkins, and the risk of developing gynecological diseases.

### Call for Action
The visibility of menstrual poverty has increased in recent years, but it is not yet enough. What we can do as ordinary people includes discussing the issue with your friends and family, stop joking about menstruation, actively participate in menstruation-related charity events, and donate to make clean sanitary napkins available to women in backward areas.

# Data
Due to the lack of a large scale, worldwide dataset for this topic. Most of the data used in this project were obtained from various surveys reports or news release.
- [UN National Accounts Main Aggregates Database](https://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Index): The National Accounts Main Aggregates Database provides a series of national accounts analysis tables for more than 200 countries and territories around the world since 1970. This data will be used to calculate the sanitary pads price to per capita GDP ratio.
- [WAGGGS and WASH United Menstrual Hygiene Day 2020](https://ureport.in/opinion/4258/): WAGGGS and WASH United organized a poll for Menstrual Hygiene Day on May 28, 2020, to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on girls' and young women's menstrual hygiene and management. 3,910 girls and young women from 160 countries participated in the poll. The data will be used to demonstrate the current situation of menstrual shame.
- [Expatistan](https://www.expatistan.com/): Expatistan.com is dedicated to serving expatriates around the world. It is a database of prices of various items in various cities and countries around the world. This data will be used to calculate the sanitary pads price to per capita GDP ratio.
- [THINX Research](https://www.thinx.com/?utm_source=pepperjam&utm_medium=paid%7Caffiliate&utm_campaign=thinx%7Call%7Cpro%7Cconversions%7Cna&utm_term=120661&clickId=4182385779&utm_content=8-11395): THINX organized a new survey of 1,500 women and 500 men across the United States in September 2017 to learn about menstrual shame. The data will be used to demonstrate the current situation of menstrual shame.
- [State Sales Tax](https://allianceforperiodsupplies.org/tampon-tax/): The site summarizes the taxation of sanitary pads by state within the United States, as well as period product tax achievements and current efforts. This data will be used to show the history and current status of taxation of period products.
- [Period Tax](https://periodtax.org/map.html): The database summarizes the global taxation of sanitary pads, as well as information on related campaigns. This data will be used to show the history and current status of taxation of period products.

# Method and Medium
I will be using Tableau to complete my entire visualization and using Shorthand to build a story. Since the data may need cleaning as well as pre-processing, I will mainly use excel and python to pre-process the data or directly get the numbers needed to make the story.

For final presentation, I would like to give a brief review of my project using Shorthand.
