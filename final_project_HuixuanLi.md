# Outline
## Summary
In the year 2022, menstrual poverty is still widespread today. This project will focus on two aspects of menstrual poverty: cognitive poverty and economic poverty. Cognitive poverty leads to socio-cultural shame and taboos about menstruation, which perpetuates the invisible environmental pressure on women. Economic poverty, on the other hand, can lead to difficulties in accessing physiological health knowledge and menstrual hygiene products, posing a threat to women's health.

## Project Structure
### Basic Menstruation Info
First I will use a series of visual data on menstruation to construct basic knowledge for those who do not have an understanding of it. For example, I am going to use the following data:
- A woman will have her period more than 450 times in her lifetime
- Women menstruate for about 10 years of their lives
- A woman will consume 11,000 tampons in her lifetime

With the above data, the audience will learn that menstruation is not a taboo and insignificant topic, but an important issue for all women.

### Cognitive Poverty
In this section I will discuss menstrual shame. Even though menstruation is such a normal physiological phenomenon (as described in the previous section), it is still taboo and even a disease in some disadvantaged regions. 
I will begin with case studies from some countries, such as Nepal, where women have to leave their homes during menstruation and go to menstrual huts to spend their periods. In China, women who are menstruating are considered "unclean" and are not allowed to attend funerals.
After that I will show some data from the survey, such as whether you can talk openly about menstruation, the percentage of women who feel shame, the percentage of men who joke about their partner's menstruation, the percentage of women who have hidden tampons, etc. With this data, I expect the audience to realize that menstrual shame is a real thing, and that there are many women who are feeling pressure and even verbal violence because of this female specific biological phenomenon. And it's not just about women, it's about the oppression of women brought on by men and society as a whole.

# Method and Medium
I will be using Tableau to complete my entire visualization and using Shorthand to build a story. Since the data may need cleaning as well as pre-processing, I will mainly use excel and python to pre-process the data or directly get the numbers needed to make the story.
