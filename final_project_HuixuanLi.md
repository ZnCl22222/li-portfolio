# Outline
## Summary
In the year 2022, menstrual poverty is still widespread today. This project will focus on two aspects of menstrual poverty: cognitive poverty and economic poverty. Cognitive poverty leads to socio-cultural shame and taboos about menstruation, which perpetuates the invisible environmental pressure on women. Economic poverty, on the other hand, can lead to difficulties in accessing physiological health knowledge and menstrual hygiene products, posing a threat to women's health.

## Project Structure
### Basic Menstruation Info
First I will use a series of visual data on menstruation to construct basic knowledge for those who do not have an understanding of it. For example, I am going to use the following data:
- A woman will have her period more than 450 times in her lifetime
- Women menstruate for about 10 years of their lives
- A woman will consume 11,000 tampons in her lifetime

With the above data, the audience will learn that menstruation is not a taboo and insignificant topic, but an important issue for all women.

# Initial Sketches

# Data

# Method and Medium
I will be using Tableau to complete my entire visualization and using Shorthand to build a story. Since the data may need cleaning as well as pre-processing, I will mainly use excel and python to pre-process the data or directly get the numbers needed to make the story.
